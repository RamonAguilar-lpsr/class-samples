    <p>
    The destruction of the United starts with this man becoming president.
    </p>
    <p>
    Just him being alive is what causes some sort of destruction in this world, that should not happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe we should do what he is trying to do and deport him out of the U.S. and actually make America great again.

    <p> An honest opinion from a girl in my classroom over the subject of Donald Trump is that he should just leave immediately, and stop trying to "Make America great again."
    To add on to the subject she also said that if he doesn't like immigrants, why does he get a spray tan to make himself appear tan, when he just looks like his skin is completely orange.
